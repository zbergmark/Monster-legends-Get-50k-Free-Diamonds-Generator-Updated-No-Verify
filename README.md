Monster Legends is a multiplayer RPG game in which you’re in charge of raising the monsters from the unhatched eggs and turning them into fearsome fighters to fight against other monsters. The game features hundreds of unique monsters with various abilities, and you can breed those monsters to create a new species. As you level up in the game, you’ll improve a Monster Paradise, which is essentially your monster’s habitat where you take care of them. The battle system is turn-based, similar to traditional RPG titles, and it requires various tactics and planning to defeat your opponents. In addition, there is also a leaderboard system for more competitive players, with the rewards for the best among the best. 

The visual quality of the Monster Legends resembles the cartoon, with very smooth animations and a decent number of details. This is coupled with monster sound effects and soundtracks, for a more immersive gaming experience.
